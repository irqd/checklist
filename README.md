# Checklist - A simple task management application.

## 1. About the Project

Checklist is a simple task management application built using Laravel and Livewire. It allows users to manage their tasks. It is also my recap project since it has been a while since I played around with Livewire.

### Key Features

- **Categories and Tags:** Users can create categories and tags to organize their tasks. 

- **Managing Tasks:** Users can create, update, and delete tasks. They can also mark tasks as completed.

## 2. Concepts used in Livewire for this project

- **Nesting:** Livewire components can be nested within each other. This allows you to create complex interfaces by breaking them down into smaller components.

- **Events:** Livewire components can communicate with each other using events. This allows you to update one component based on changes in another component.

- **Pagination:** Livewire components can be paginated to display a large number of items in a more manageable way.

- **Forms:** Livewire components can be used to create forms that can be reused across the application.

- **SPA Navigation:** Livewire is capable of creating SPA like applications by using its navigation features. Instead of reloading the entire page, it updates the page via AJAX requests.

- **Reactive/Modelable Properties:** Livewire components can have reactive properties that can be updated in real-time. This allows you to create dynamic interfaces that respond to user input or changes in the application state.
